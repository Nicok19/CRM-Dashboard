# DownloadPDF Component Documentation

## Overview

The `DownloadPDF` component is a React functional component that generates and downloads a PDF document containing charts from the CRM Dashboard project. It uses `jsPDF` for PDF generation and `html2canvas` for capturing charts as images.

## Component Functionality

1. **Button for Downloading PDF**

   - **`handleDownloadPDF`**: Function that handles the PDF generation and download process.

2. **PDF Generation Process**

   - **Title and Description**: Sets the title and description of the PDF document.
   - **Hide Buttons**: Temporarily hides buttons with the class `.edit-data-button` to avoid them being included in the PDF.
   - **Capture Charts**: Uses `html2canvas` to capture images of elements with the class `.chart-container` and adds them to the PDF.
   - **Restore Button Styles**: Restores the original display styles of the buttons after the PDF generation.

3. **Rendering**

   - **Button**: A button that triggers the PDF download when clicked. Styled for both light and dark modes.

## Example Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import DownloadPDF from './DownloadPDF';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components and content */}
      <DownloadPDF />
    </div>
  );
};
